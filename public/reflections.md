### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.

1. Arithmetic Operators - These operators are used for mathematical equations. The plus operator can also be used to combine variables that are strings. We previously learned how to use these operators during our discussion about c++. We use them all the time for our different exercises. 

2. Comparison Operators - These operators are used to compare values. There are many different operators like equal, not equal, greater than, less than, and many more. We have also discussed these while learning c++ and often use it during exercises. 

3. Control Statements - Control Statements are used to control the flow of your code. We discussed all of the control statements while discussing c++. I’m very familiar with these kinds of statements and I can use them in the exercises. 

4. Input Statements - Input statements are the basic statements used to process values. These statements were a bit different from c++. I learned how to use them through lessons and exercises.

5. Variable Declaration - This topic taught me how to declare variables in js. Some of the keywords were familiar through c++, but some were new to me. I learned to master the usage of these keywords through the different exercises. 

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. Functions - I’m not very good at using functions because some parts confuse me. Even during our lectures about c++, I struggled with the use of functions overall. I hope to master it through more discussions and exercises. 

2. Loop Control Structures - I am able to use most loops and can use them while coding. I sometimes struggle with starting the loop when I don’t know which one to use. I need to practice more on using for loops and learning which loops are needed for a certain coding prompt. 

3. Event Handlers - I encounter som trouble with event handlers. I’m not very sure on how to use them. I hope to understand them more through discussions and master their use through practice exercises. 

4. Logical Operators - I’m familiar with logical operators and can use the && and || easily. However, I sometimes struggle with understanding them once there is a ! involved. I can still understand the statement, but it takes me a while to fully understand the output. With a bit more practice, I hope to master this topic more. 

5. Output Statements - I know how to use the different output statements. I just get confused sometimes on which one to use. For example, which one is used for debugging, which one is used for quick outputs. I can memorize them for the tests, but I want to master using each of the output statements. 

### Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
	
1. I can consult my teacher or ask my classmates to help me understand the topics. I will try to do more research on the topics that I don’t understand. There are also many sources where I can learn more about them like youtube videos or learning websites. There are different ways that I can learn more about these, but it all depends on how hard I’m willing to work. 

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think are not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

1. Both the Non-graded and Graded exercises helped me understand the topics because they helped me apply what I’ve learned in class. Doing the non-graded tasks, with the guidance of Ma’am, and the graded tasks after were the perfect combination that helped me effectively understand the topics and helped me to code better. I also really liked the pre-test because it forced me to study in advance and prepared me for the lecture.
